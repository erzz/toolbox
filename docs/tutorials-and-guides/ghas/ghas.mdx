# Github Advanced Security

## Introduction

GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) is a set of security features and tools provided by GitHub to help
developers identify and address security vulnerabilities in their code. It's designed to enhance the
overall security of software development on the GitHub platform. Key components of GitHub Advanced
Security include:

- **[Code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning)**

  Analyses the code in a GitHub repository to find security vulnerabilities and coding errors. Any
  problems identified by the analysis are shown in your repository. It also enables 3rd party tool
  integration through the SARIF report format.

- **[Secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning)**

  Detect secrets, for example keys and tokens, that have been committed to repositories. Secret
  scanning alerts for users and secret scanning alerts for partners are available and free of charge
  for public repositories on GitHub.com. If push protection is enabled, it also detects secrets when
  they are pushed to your repository.

- **[Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts)**

  Detects dependencies that have a known security vulnerability and creates pull requests for
  patched versions. Show the full impact of changes to dependencies and see details of any
  vulnerable versions before you merge a pull request.

  :::tip

  Dependabot can also be configured to keep dependencies up to date regardless of whether they have
  a security vulnerability or not.

## Enabling Github Advanced Security

All security related jobs should integrate with Github Advanced Security.

This enables you to view and manage all security findings in the Security Overview dashboard for
your repository.

Workflows and jobs that are integrated with GHAS require that you enable Github Advanced Security
for your repository first, otherwise. they will fail because they will not be able to upload the
SARIF reports.

:::tip Admin required

As with most repository configuration, you will need the `Admin` or `Maintainer` role for the
repository in order to enable Github Advanced Security.

## Dependabot

### Quick Guide

Different features of Dependabot serve different purposes:

1. **Dependabot alerts:** These are notifications you receive when Dependabot detects a
   vulnerability in one of your dependencies. It's a way to keep you informed about potential
   security risks in your project.
2. **Dependabot security updates:** When Dependabot finds a security vulnerability in one of your
   dependencies, it not only alerts you, but it can also automatically open a pull request to update
   the vulnerable dependency to a secure version. This feature is specifically focused on addressing
   security vulnerabilities.
3. **Grouped security updates:** This featured can be used to combine multiple dependency updates
   into a single pull request. This can be useful if you have a lot of dependencies or dependencies
   that usually need to be updated together.
4. **Dependabot version updates:** This feature is more about keeping your dependencies up-to-date
   in general, not just in response to security vulnerabilities. Dependabot can periodically check
   if there are newer versions of your dependencies available and open pull requests to update them.
   This helps you take advantage of the latest features and improvements in your dependencies.

In summary, while all the above features are related to managing dependencies in your project,
Dependabot alerts and security updates are specifically about addressing security vulnerabilities,
while version updates are about keeping your dependencies up-to-date with the latest versions.

### Configuring Dependabot

The configuration file `.github/dependabot.yml` is used to control how Dependabot behaves in your
repository.

The configuration file can be used to control both Dependabot security updates and Dependabot
version updates. If you want to receive security updates but not version updates, you can set
open-pull-requests-limit to 0 for a given package-ecosystem. This will prevent Dependabot from
opening pull requests for version updates, but it will still open pull requests for security
updates.

## Code Scanning

### Enabling advanced mode

When a repository is enabled with GHAS, it is enabled with default, built in, CodeQL configuration.
This config is very generic and will try to autodetect the language and autobuild the application.

This may well work for your case, however many projects require special build commands, need to
authenticate to private registries, or have other special requirements. In this case using the
advanced configuration via reusable workflows SAST job will be more suitable and allow you to
customise the job to your needs.

You can follow the steps below to customize your scanning, such as declaring specific build steps,
folders/file to ignore or exclude during scanning.

In order to enable advanced mode, repository admin can:

1. Go to **Settings** -> **Code security and analysis**
2. Under the **Code Scanning** section -> **CodeQL analysis** click the **Set up** button
3. Select the **Advanced** mode option.
4. It will prompt with a suggested commit for an implementation workflow, click **Cancel Changes**
   and OK to discard changes
5. Your repository is now in advanced mode, where you can use any workflow to execute the custom
   SAST jobs included in these workflows.

[Code Scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/configuring-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning)

### Protection rules for CodeQL

You can create protection rules to prevent merging of pull requests that introduce security issues
based on severity. This option is found under **Settings -> Code Security and Analysis -> Protection
Rules**.

## Secret Scanning

Secret scanning will scan your entire Git history on all branches present in your GitHub repository
for secrets. Additionally, it also scans:

- Descriptions and comments in issues
- Titles, descriptions, and comments, in open and closed historical issues
- Titles, descriptions, and comments in pull requests
- Titles, descriptions, and comments in GitHub Discussions

### Secret Scanning settings

- **[Secret Validation](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/secret-scanning/secret-scanning-patterns#high-confidence-patterns):**
  GHAS does validity checks for some of the partner secrets, it checks if the secret identified is
  still active or inactive.

- **[Push protection](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/secret-scanning/push-protection-for-repositories-and-organizations#about-push-protection-for-repositories-and-organizations)** -
  With push protection for repositories and organizations, secret scanning blocks contributors from
  pushing secrets to a repository and generates an alert whenever a contributor bypasses the
  protection.

You can configure a `secret_scanning.yml` file to exclude directories from secret scanning,
including when you use push protection. For example, you can exclude directories that contain tests
or randomly generated content that would cause a false positive.

Read more about configuring a
[secret_scanning.yml](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/configuring-secret-scanning-for-your-repositories#excluding-directories-from-secret-scanning-alerts-for-users)

## Workflow permissions

Workflows that integrate with Github Advanced Security must have the following permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read
  security-events: write
  # if the workflow uses OIDC / Workload Identity Federation
  tokens: write
```

:::tip

All reusable workflows from this repository request their own permissions! So if you are using a
reusable workflow you don't need to worry about this setting. But other jobs in the same workflow
may need to be configured to have the correct permissions.
