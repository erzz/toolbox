## Purpose

This workflow will build and deploy a static application to GitHub pages.

## Configuration Notes

### Enable Pages

Currently, pages needs to be enabled manually in the repository settings. This is a one-time task
which in the near future will also be more easily automated but the functionality is still in Alpha
at Github.

So for now, you must configure the repository Settings > Pages. Typically you would configure:

- Source: Deploy from a branch
- Branch: gh-pages
- Directory: / (root)
- Custom domain: (if you have one)

### Build authentication

Secrets are provided for build-time authentication with private package registries such as
Artifactory, NPM etc.

There are options to provide an `auth-token` and/or `auth-token-2` where the environment variable
they are exposed as is configurable.

For example you could expose `auth-token: NPM_TOKEN=${{ secrets.SOME_SECRET }}` or
`auth-token: ARTIFACTORY_AUTH_TOKEN=${{ secrets.SOME_SECRET }}` depending on what your build process
requires.

### Pre commands

There are options to run pre-commands before the install and build of your site if required.

### Force orphan

By default, the `gh-pages` branch is created as an orphan branch with only the latest build. This is
to stop your repository ballooning in size with every build due to a commit history full of compiled
files. If you need to keep the history of the gh-pages branch you can disable this feature.

### Disable NodeJS

This workflow assumes you will need NodeJS by default. Not every site does (Hugo for example) so the
workflow can be configured to disable the setup of NodeJS and shave a few seconds off the build
time.

## Additional Examples

### Run pre-commands

Useful for installing extra binaries, dependencies or manipulating files before the build.

```yaml
deploy-pages:
  uses: ingka-group-digital/workflows/.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml@v2
  with:
    pre-commands: |
      echo "Installing dart-sass"
      sudo snap install dart-sass
```

### Custom commands & Auth tokens

Most relevant commands are customisable, even with multiple commands using the `|` syntax. You can
pass in any environment variables you need to the commands for authentication with private package
registries.

```yaml
deploy-pages:
  uses: ingka-group-digital/workflows/.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml@v2
  with:
    install-command: npm ci
  secrets:
    auth-token: "NPM_TOKEN=${{ secrets.GH_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN }}"
    auth-token-2: "ARTIFACTORY_AUTH_TOKEN=${{ secrets.ARTIFACTORY_AUTH_TOKEN }}"
```
