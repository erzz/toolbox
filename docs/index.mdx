# Introduction

## What is this?

A collection of reusable workflows, actions, and other GitHub-related content that I use frequently.

## Why?

So I can use it of course! But also, if you wish, you can use it all too.

Even better, if you want a fix, have a suggestion, want to add some workflows or actions, go for it!

## How can I use this?

Reusable workflows are like a pipeline in a box. If you have ever tried to keep workflows consistent
across multiple repositories, you know how much of a pain it can be. Especially when various actions
and libs need to be updated over time within workflows that can be 1000's of lines of YAML. This is
where reusable workflows come in.

A reusable workflow combines numerous related jobs into a single workflow with a specific purpose.
When the workflows is updated, all repositories that use it will automatically get the changes.

## Example

As a good demonstrative case, the [container](workflows/container/container.mdx) workflow doesn't
just build a container image, it also authenticates with the registry, pushes the result to the
registry, checks it for security and best practices, handles things like automatic tagging and
more - all with a few lines of yaml!

```yaml
name: Container

on: push

jobs:
  container:
    uses: erzz/toolbox/.github/workflows/container.yml@v1
    with:
      image: my-image
    secrets:
      wip: ${{ secrets.YOUR_SECRET }}
      service-account: ${{ secrets.YOUR_SECRET }}
```

That's it! As you build more and more images for different projects the only thing you are likely to
change is the image name. Everything else is handled for you.
