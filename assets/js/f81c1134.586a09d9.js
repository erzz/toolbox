Often I\\nproduce something at work and need to replicate it with any internal stuff removed. Sometimes I will\\ndeliver it first here and then customise it internally for work.\\n\\nOther times I will just come up with random scripts, find great references or need to write some\\ncode to glue something together - with a central place to store it all.\\n\\nHopefully, others will find it useful too - but even if they don\'t ... I will have at least one\\nhappy user, me!\\n\\nThis site will be the documentation and references for the things in the repo. It\'s built using the\\nfantastic [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) extensively at work and it is a great tool for easily\\nproducing not only documentation, but **AUTOMATED** documentation - which is a godsend instead of\\nneeding to manually copy paste inputs, outputs, screenshots etc."}]}}')}}]);
