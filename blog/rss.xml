            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a lot of things in progress, delivered internally at work, delivered as open source and some
that I just want to share with the world.</p>
<p>This site is a place for me to share all of that but also act as my own personal portal to things I
need all the time, yet forget even where I delivered or found them.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it will be mostly Github Actions and Reusable workflows for various projects. Often I
produce something at work and need to replicate it with any internal stuff removed. Sometimes I will
deliver it first here and then customise it internally for work.</p>
<p>Other times I will just come up with random scripts, find great references or need to write some
code to glue something together - with a central place to store it all.</p>
<p>Hopefully, others will find it useful too - but even if they don't ... I will have at least one
happy user, me!</p>
<p>This site will be the documentation and references for the things in the repo. It's built using the
fantastic <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a> extensively at work and it is a great tool for easily
producing not only documentation, but <strong>AUTOMATED</strong> documentation - which is a godsend instead of
needing to manually copy paste inputs, outputs, screenshots etc.</p>]]></content:encoded>
